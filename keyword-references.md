2. **Search Volume Forecast:** Use "Get search volume and forecasts" to enter all 15 Google Ads keywords. Screenshot the forecast page showing impressions, clicks, and cost estimates.
3. **Grouped View:** Screenshot the keyword ideas in "Grouped view" to show how Google clusters related keywords into thematic groups.

### WordStream Free Keyword Tool (wordstream.com/keywords)

2. **Related Keywords Section:** Screenshot the "Related Keywords" suggestions that WordStream generates alongside your primary results.
3. **Multiple Searches:** Capture at least 2-3 separate searches showing different seed keywords from your assigned list, demonstrating that you explored multiple keyword clusters.

### SEMrush (semrush.com)
1. **Keyword Magic Tool:** Screenshot the main results page after entering your seed keyword, showing the keyword list with Volume, Keyword Difficulty (KD%), CPC, and SERP Features columns.
2. **Keyword Overview:** For at least 2-3 of your assigned keywords, capture the Keyword Overview page that shows the trend graph, global volume, and top organic results.
3. **SERP Analysis:** Screenshot the SERP analysis for one keyword, showing which pages currently rank in the top 10 and their authority metrics.

### General Tips for Screenshots
- Make sure the date is visible in the browser or tool interface to prove the research was conducted recently
- Include the full browser URL bar in screenshots to verify you are using the correct tool
- Use full-page screenshots rather than cropped images where possible
- Save screenshots with descriptive filenames (e.g., `google-ads-seo-for-beginners.png`, `semrush-email-marketing-roi.png`)
- If a tool requires a paid account for certain features, note in your report which features were accessed via free vs. paid tiers
